First of all, the main class of the code will exist in the “BinarySearchTreeImplementation.java” file. In Visual Studio Code, there will be a run and debug button on the top of the public static void main to allow the user to run and debug the code as shown in Figure 1.0. After the user has clicked on the run button, the system’s console will prompt the user to enter ten integers using a for-loop method that will prompt ten scanner that will scan the user’s response and data.

Next, after the user has entered a value, the system will display the value that has been entered by the user to double confirm if they have entered the correct value. After the 10 values are inserted, the initial in-order, pre-order, post-order traversal will be shown below the insertion method. Besides that, the maximum and minimum value will also be displayed below the three traversal methods. After the system has displayed the initial results, the system will prompt the user to enter an integer/value for the user to check if the value existed in the tree.

After the user has entered an integer, the system will check if the integer exists in the tree or not and will be displaying the result accordingly. Next, the system will then proceed to prompt the user a message for the user to enter an integer to delete from the tree. The figure on the left shows if the value existed in the tree and the figure on the right shows if the value does not exist in the tree

After the user has entered a value to delete, the system will display the number to delete, and it will find the next number in the tree to perform the in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversal. The updated results of the three traversal methods will be shown with the updated values that has the value deleted.
