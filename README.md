CSC2103: Data Structures and Algorithms


Assignment - Total marks 20 Due: Week 12

The aim of this assignment is to achieve the learning outcome [3] of this subject. You are required to implement a group project with appropriate data structures and algorithms for real-world problems. This assignment contributes 20% of your final grade. You are allowed to work in a group of 4 students. Your group need to demonstrate your work at the time of submission.

Assignment requirements
Each group needs to use appropriate data structures and algorithms to implement a visualization or simulation (Kind of Demo app) for any TWO (2) problems listed in the following section (Problems List). 

You are encouraged to use Java programming language for the implementation; however, you are allowed to choose the programming language of your choice. The marks will be
based on the use of appropriate data structures and the accuracy of algorithms, and support the essential operations involved in it.
